Legend of Zelda: Link's Dream
------------------------------
Legend of Zelda Fangame created in 2020 for a class project.  
Developed in Python, uses Pygame library for graphics, and applies object-oriented programming principles to organize code.  
Consists of a 3-4 areas, mobs, items/collectables, NPCs, and a dungeon.  
Uses sprites from The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap for a mix of reused and original areas/enemies/items/etc.  
  
Currently this is the original submitted version, but could use some bugfixing.
